# RFM Analysis on Spark

On this repository, I will show how to make an RFM analysis using pySpark (Databricks Community Edition).

The notebooks are in the script directory and the html file is in the output directory.

The used data can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset).

As I used Databricks Community Edition, it is necesary to load the data first.
