# RFM Analysis on Spark

On this repository, I will show how to make an RFM analysis using Spark (Databricks Community Edition).

The notebooks are in script directory and the html file is in output directory.

The used data can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset).
